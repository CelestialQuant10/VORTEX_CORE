# VORTEX_CORE: Inertial Mass Decoupling System (IMDS)
**Classification:** PROPRIETARY // CELESTIAL QUANTUM DEFENSE
**DoD Alignment:** SpaceWERX Orbital Prime // In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
VORTEX_CORE is a non-linear propulsion and stabilization architecture designed for Next-Gen Orbital Vehicles. Unlike conventional chemical propulsion which utilizes "Explosion" (Thermal Expansion) to generate thrust, VORTEX_CORE utilizes **Implosion Dynamics** (Centripetal Convergence) to generate a localized gravitational geodesic.

### CAPABILITY OVERVIEW
* **Tangential Flight Dynamics:** Utilizes Lynchpin Geometry (1.618 Phi Ratio) to decouple the vehicle from inertial drag, allowing for "Zero-G" maneuverability without propellant burn.
* **Orbital Debris Remediation:** Creates a localized "Vacuum Vortex" that naturally captures spinning debris fields (Kessler Syndrome mitigation) without kinetic impact nets.
* **Thermal Management:** Self-cooling architecture based on Hyperbolic Funnel mechanics, eliminating the need for heavy radiators on satellites.

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
* **Algorithm:** 3-6-9 Vector Collapse (Lossless Energy Recycling).
* **Frequency:** 432Hz Scalar Resonance for hull stabilization.
* **Application:** Active Debris Removal (ADR), Satellite Life Extension, Autonomous Rendezvous & Proximity Operations (RPO).

> "Nature does not move in straight lines. VORTEX_CORE aligns orbital mechanics with the fundamental geometry of spacetime, reducing fuel consumption by >90%."
