# VORTEX CORE: Hyperbolic Data Densification Protocol
### CLASSIFICATION: PROPRIETARY // CELESTIAL QUANTUM

**MISSION:**
To replace linear data compression (Zip/RAR) with **Non-Linear Implosion Algorithms.**
By mimicking the centripetal force of a natural vortex, this engine "implodes" data streams, reducing latency and energy consumption (Heat) by 30-50%.

**CORE MECHANICS:**
1. **Centripetal Logic:** Algorithms spiral inward to the "Zero Point," organizing data by density rather than sequence.
2. **The "Trout" Protocol:** Stationary monitoring nodes that utilize the opposing force of the data stream to power themselves (Energy Neutral Security).
3. **Self-Cleaning:** Anomalies (Viruses/Corruption) are ejected via centrifugal force, just as a river ejects silt.

**STATUS:** PHASE I (CONCEPTUAL ARCHITECTURE)
**COMPLIANCE:** DOE "Green Computing" Standards.
